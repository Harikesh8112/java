                                       ****28/11/2022***** 
Constructor:- Constructor is a special method , which is used to initialize variable .
The constructor has following propertion :-
1. constructor name is same class name.
2. constructor doesn't return any value .
3. constructor coll automatically as soon as object is createed.

Inheritance:- In Inheritance you can create a new class by using existing class.Existing class is called base / super / parent class and new created class is called derived / sud /child class.
Note :: The concept of inheritance is also called 'Reusability' .
         class A
		 {
		 //code
		 }
		 class B extends A
		 { 
		 //code
		 }
		 
Types of Inheritance supported in java :- In java programming language there are three types of inheritance are supported
1. single Inheritance
2. Hierarchical Inheritance
3. Multi-level inheritance

1 single inheritance :- single inheritance there is a single base class and single derived class.
  Syntax 
          class A
		  {
		  //code 
		  }
		  class B extends A
		  {
		  //code 
		  }
		  
		  
2 Hierarchical inheritance:- in Hierarchical inheritance there is a single base class and multiple derived classes.
    syntax -
	class A
	{
	//code
	}
	class B extends A
	{
	//code
	}
	class c extends A
	{
	//code
	}
	
3 multi-level inheritance:- 

      syntax 
	  class A
	  {
	  //code
	  }
	  class B extends A
	  {
	  //code
	  }
	  class C extends B
	  {
	  //code
	  }

	Polymorphise in java :- The term Polymorphise meanu one thing many forms . In java programming language there are two types of Polymorphise :-
	1. comile time Polymorphise (method overlodimg)
	2. Run tim   e Polymorphise (method overriding)
	
	Method Overloading:- In java programming language you can create multiple method with same name in same class but their parameters should be different .
	Based on method parameters it is decided at compilation time that which method call from where.This concept is called method overloadimg.
	method parameters can be different in two types :-
	1. Number of parameters can be different.
	2. Types of parameters can be different.
	
	Method Overriding:- Re-writing of base class method into derived class is called method overriding. 
	Rules to perform method overriding in java :-
	1. Class must be inherited.
	2. Base class method name and derived class method name must be same.
	3. Base class method parameters and derived class method parameters must be same.

Multi-threading:-the concept of multithreading is taken from the concept of multitasking.
In Multithreading sysetm CPU switches between multiple processes whereas in multithreading system CPU switches between multiple sub-processes(Threads).
